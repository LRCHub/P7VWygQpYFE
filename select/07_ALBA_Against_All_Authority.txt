Black beans on the stove, malta in my hand,
Tears in alba's eyes as she dreams of a far away land
"I've been stripped from my country, i've been spit on by
My race". i said, "it'll be okay" as i wiped a tear from her
Face and she said" no quieroir la mentira que vivo aqui!"
"Yo quiero volver a mi pais!" "you'll never know the pain
I feel inside, i've been striped from my country and robbed
Of my pride". i don't know where i'm gonna go but i
Don't belong here!
