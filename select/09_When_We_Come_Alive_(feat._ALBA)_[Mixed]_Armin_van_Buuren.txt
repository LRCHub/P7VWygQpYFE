Lights
Calling me over
You
Make me go under
Silhouettes dancing like shadow
Live in the nocturnal hours
You
Make me go under, yeah

All we do is la la la
Losing our mi-mi-minds
Waiting for the ni-ni-night
That's when we come alive

All we do is la la la
Losing our mi-mi-minds
Waiting for the ni-ni-night
That's when we come alive

All we do is la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

That's when we come alive

All we do is la la la
Losing our mi-mi-minds
Waiting for the ni-ni-night
That's when we come alive

All we do is la la la
Losing our mi-mi-minds
Waiting for the ni-ni-night
That's when we come alive

That's when we come alive

The moon
Is taking me over
Fools
Rushing like water
Pierce through the air like a siren
We come to break up the silence
You
Make me go under, yeah

That's when we come alive

All we do is la la la
Losing our mi-mi-minds
Waiting for the ni-ni-night
That's when we come alive

All we do is la la la
Losing our mi-mi-minds
Waiting for the ni-ni-night
That's when we come alive
